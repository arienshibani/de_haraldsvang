## About 
`de_haraldsvang` is a recreation of the original Haraldsvang School in Haugesund, as it stood from its opening in 1970 until its [demolition in 2024](https://www.haugesund.kommune.no/aktuelt/gamleskolen-rives.29234.aspx). The final interpretation is based on the original blueprints by the legendary architect [David Sandved](https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Sandved), combined with the personal memories of former students. 

> It is more than just a map, it is a nostalgic time capsule of a building that served as one of Norway’s largest high schools for over 50 years.
